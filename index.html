<h3>About me</h3>
<p>
  Since I was a kid, I was very curious about technology and always wondered its limits and now i have reach a mind where i can fully understand exactly how tech works and how to
    to meld it. Ever since i got my first phone my future was decided, i wanted to be a software engineer and nothing else. I study hard to get good result or grades so that i can study in college of my dreams.
    In my opinion technology defines human evolution. from room sized computers to gaming notebooks we have come a long way. we are evolving and evolving rapidly. I have completed my school with a percentage of 74% and my inter with 89%.
    currently i have no backlogs in my graduation as of my 6th sem. my avg gpa has been around 7.3.

<h3>hobbies</h3>
<p> One of my favourite things to do is photography. I am deeply in love with photography, you can check my Instagram profile to check out my latest work. I love taking self-portraits. The reason I take self portraits is that one I don’t have someone who understands camera and second others can really understand what you want your photo to look like, a portrait of you is description of yourself and no one can describe you as good as you yourself. Ill link my social media in my contact section.</p>
